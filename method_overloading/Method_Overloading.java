 * If a class have multiple methods by same name but different parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.

Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any number of arguments, 
* if you write the method such as a(int,int) for two parameters, and b(int,int,int) 
* for three parameters then it may be difficult for you as well as other programmers to understand the behaviour 
* of the method because its name differs. So, we perform method overloading to figure out the program quickly.
* 
* Advantage of method overloading?
Method overloading increases the readability of the program.

Different ways to overload the method
* 
There are two ways to overload the method in java
By changing number of arguments
By changing the data type
